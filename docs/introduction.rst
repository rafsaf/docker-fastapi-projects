Introduction
============


The Structure of this project
-----------------------------

Each chapter is another application and at the same time a repository on `GitHub`_. You can go ahead and download it to your computer or your virtual machine and follow the steps or simply read and try out these configurations in your projects. Each subsequent application in this section is more and more advanced, from a simple hello-world on a localhost to production applications with a database and an authentication system included.

.. CAUTION::
    Please note that even if we try to faithfully recreate production applications here, probably none of them is suitable for even a simple production API and should not be a template for any **serious** project. They are written to help you understand the basics.

The Structure of each chapter
-----------------------------

* Application structure
* Files description
* Local deployment
* Production deployment*
* Troubleshoots

``\* The first (dead simple) app only has a chapter on local deployment.``
